### COURSE DESCRIPTION:

This course covers basic techniques in probability and statistics applied using the R statistical programming language. The course starts with introducing students to R for data import, manipulation, and visualization. Statistical topics include descriptive statistics, sampling techniques, discrete probability models, sampling, statistical distributions, correlation, and null hypothesis testing.

cat(paste0('* ', plo[plo$ID %in% plos,]$Learning_Outcome, collapse = '\n'))
```


### COURSE LEARNING OUTCOMES:

1.  Effectively use R for conducting analysis, creating reports, and presenting results
2.  Estimate predictive models using both parametric and non-parametric models.
3.  Communicate the accuracy of predictive models using a variety of fit statistics
4.  Have strategies for handling missing data in the predictive modeling pipeline.
5.  Effectively communicate the results of a predictive models

### STUDENTS WILL BE ABLE TO:

* Effectively use R for conducting analysis, creating reports, and presenting results. 
* Understand the foundations of probability theory and perform basic probability calculations.
* Build basic stochastic models for commonly encountered data science.
* Explore and summarize data using descriptive statistics.
* Test hypotheses using classical and modern computational techniques.
* Calculate and define the relationship between multiple variables.

### ASSIGNMENTS AND GRADING:

**Data Project** (25% Total; Proposal 5%, Final Presentation 20%)

The purpose of the data project is for you to conduct a reproducible analysis with a data set of your choosing. There are two components to the project, the proposal, which will be graded on a pass/fail basis, and the final report. The outline for each of these are provided in the templates. When submitting the assignments, include the R Markdown file (change the name to include your last name, for example LASTNAME-Proposal.Rmd and LASTNAME-Project.Rmd) along with any supplementary files necessary to run the R Markdown file (e.g. data files, screenshots, etc.). Suggestions for possible data sources are included below, however you are free to use data not listed below. The only requirement is that you are allowed to share the data. Projects will be shared with others on this website, so they should be presented in a way that other students can reproduce your analysis.

**Labs** (50%): R is the statistical software you will use for this course. The labs aim to provide an opportunity for you to apply your statistical content knowledge in the context of problems to solve in R, thus also providing you the opportunity to practice and become familiar with the R platform and language. The labs will be guided; thus, step-by-step procedures will be laid out for you to follow in order to get the desired outputs. Interpretations of results are just as important as the results themselves, so once you have the results, interpret them in the context of the problems. Labs are graded based on completion, accuracy, and thoroughness of results and interpretations.

**Final Exam** (15%): Exams will consist of conceptual, computational, and application questions, an include a combination of multiple choice, short response questions, as well as a data analysis task. The exams will focus on the material covered during the course of the semester. More detail will be provided about the material assessed by each exam closer in time to the actual exams. It should be noted that most of the statistical skills acquired during this class are constantly building upon earlier learning. This means that even though each exam will focus on the preceding section of the course, students might need to recall skills learned in earlier sections.

**Participation** (10%): While attendance at synchronous meetups is not required, it is highly encouraged that you do attend: this is where you can ask questions, participate in-situ, and engage with your professor and peers. In addition, announcements and updates relating to coursework will be reviewed during these meetups. With that said, we understand that extenuating circumstances might not allow some of you to attend. Thus, we have built-in diagnostic and weekly formative assessment assignments that will give us an understanding of your current level of knowledge and lingering gaps in knowledge to be completed after attending or watching the recording of every meetup:

1.  DAACS SRL ([https://cuny.daacs.net](https://cuny.daacs.net)) and Google Form (only once, at the beginning of the semester)
2.  Weekly One-Minute Papers

You will receive full points upon completion of each of these assignments.

Whatever you produce for this course should be your own work and created specifically for this course. You cannot present work produced by others, nor any work that you presented or will present to another course. If you borrow text or media from another source or paraphrase substantial ideas from someone else, you must provide a reference to your source. If you use text written by a generation system (e.g., entering a prompt into an artificial intelligence tool and using the output in a paper), you must acknowledge its use. I will teach you how to do that in class.

### Use of Artificial Intelligence (AI)

First, AI is a marketing term. I prefer to be more specific regarding what we are doing:

Machine Learning (ML) - This course will provide the foundations for how ML algorithms work. Generally speaking, the goal is to predict some known (and sometimes unknown in the case of unsupervised learning models) outcome.

Large Language Models (LLM) - This is often what people mean when they say AI. This includes products like ChatGPT, Anthropic, Google Gemini, etc. LLMs generate text, images, videos, etc. from a prompt. The goal of this course is for *you* to develop the foundation knowledge and skills of statistics. Using chat bots to do the assignments subverts this goal. This is confounded by the fact at the content generated by LLMs is often wrong! However, when you are stuck or looking for help they can be helpful, especially if you use chat bots that provide references and/or links to sources. If you decide to use LLMs to assist in completing any assignment, you *must* include the prompt and response in your submission.
